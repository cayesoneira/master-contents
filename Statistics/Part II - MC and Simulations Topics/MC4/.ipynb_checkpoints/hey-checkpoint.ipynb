    "### *Simulate a simple version of a nuclear reactor in which the mean free path is constant (for example = 1). The mean number of neutrons in each fission is also fixed (for example to 3). Study as a function of the size of the container if the process grows exponentially or stays under control. Assume exponential law for the distance before an interaction and Poisson law for the number of neutrons.*\n",

    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that the critical diameter for the reactor is around the mean path, $l\\approx 1$. For the case with a reactor diameter of $d=0.8$, when the reaction is started with hundreds of neutrons, these and the neutrons generated by them finally escape after some generations. When $d=1.2$, the reaction explodes, adding exponentially new neutrons. We could say, then:\n",
    "- For $L<0.5$, the reaction is subcritical.\n",
    "- For $L>0.5$, the reaction is supercritical.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal working radius should be around $L\\approx0.5$, but our simulations show, due to the inherent randomness of the process, that a smooth, constant-neutron-number performance is not possible to achieve within a reactor of such characteristics. **This suggests the idea of adding an extra limiting apparatus to avoid the exponential growth of the neutron inside the container**.\n",

    "## **Metropolis for hard spheres**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The question**\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Use the Metropolis algorithm to get random numbers for pairs of non-overlapping spheres or disks of radius R in a square box of side L, uniformly distributed. Study the convergence of quantities such that the distance between spheres, or the closest distance of any sphere to a wall. Check for the cases of 2 or three disks. Compare the cases when L is large compared to R with the case when the spheres just fit into the box.*\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use the Metropolis algorithm to model the movement of some disks in a box of side $L$. This algorithm has some steps that, for our case, can be summarized as:\n",
    "1. **Generate a sample of random walkers:** we create two disks, each one in some corner of the square box to make sure thay are not overlapping.\n",
    "2. **Calculate the random walk:** we calculate a different displacement for each disk.\n",
    "3. **Evaluate q, the probability of the displacement:** we consider q=1 if the new position for the disks keeps them inside the box, a the distance to the wall given by the radius of each disk and they are not overlapping.\n",
    "4. **Accept/reject the new position with prob q:** once we have q determined we accept the displacement if q=1 and discard it if q=0.\n",
    "    - **Back to step 2**\n",
