NAME
chkupdate - Check for an available IRAF update (obsolete)
.ih
USAGE
chkupdate
.ih
DESCRIPTION
This task was designed to compare the currently installed IRAF version
with what is available from the NOAO servers. Since NOAO is
transitioning IRAF to an end-of-support state, and has taken NOAOâ€™s
IRAF distribution offline, this tool is not useful anymore. For the
Community version of IRAF, please check the web site
https://iraf-community.github.io for new versions. IRAF packages in
Linux distributions like Debian or Ubuntu are automatically kept
up-to-date.
