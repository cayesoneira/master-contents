**You need to download the program `lensmodel` before any execution.**

*You will also need to modify the `.ini` file uncommenting the `varyone` line that corresponds to you.*

To run the program, just write in the terminal the following, depending on what model you want to run. For the Singular Ellipsoid (SE) with External Shear (ES), run:

    sudo ./lensmodel QSO1339SES.ini
For the De Vacouleurs (DV) model with External Shear (ES):

    sudo ./lensmodel QSO1339DVES.ini
